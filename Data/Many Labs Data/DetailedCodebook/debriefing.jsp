<p style="text-align: center;">Debriefing</p>
<p>Thank you for your participation. Your participation is vital in helping to uncover the psychological processes that influence our 
everyday lives. </p>

<p>
During this experiment, you completed 12 different tasks that have already been demonstrated and published in psychological journals. 
We bundled these tasks into one experiment and had you complete them here because we are curious if these results will be obtained 
in different participant samples and test-taking environments.
</p>

<p>One study you completed was an Implicit Association Test. When someone asks us to report our attitude about something we consciously consider our preferences and decide how we 
feel.  We typically call this form of an attitude an &#39;explicit attitude.&#39;  For the past 20 years, psychologists have been investigating 
a different type of attitude call an &#39;implicit attitude.&#39;  As the name implies, this type of preference does not require that a person 
consciously think about their preference.  Rather, implicit attitudes are those attitudes that may exist outside conscious awareness 
or conscious control.  As such, psychologists have needed to find <i>indirect</i> ways to study them.</p>

<p>In this study, preference was measured by timing the speed with which you made judgments in the computer task.  The basic principle of 
the task is that you will be able to classify words when the groups are related (i.e., math and pleasant on the same key) faster 
compared to situations where the groups are not related (i.e., math and unpleasant on the same key).  In this way we are measuring an 
implicit preference for math that does not require that you consciously consider your feelings about math.  Instead, we assess 
the degree of association between concepts (i.e., math) and	 evaluation (i.e., pleasant and unpleasant). We argue that the speed with which you 
make these associations reflects your implicit attitude.</p>

<p>It is important to note that implicit attitudes are not more &#39;real&#39; than our self-reported preferences.  Our conscious attitudes help us decide how we want to behave with different groups of people, where we stand on political issues, or what we want to do next.  Our current understanding of implicit attitudes suggests that they form through exposure in our environment.  </p>

<p>In other parts of the study, you completed judgments about a variety of scenarios. These questions are common tasks in psychological research to investigate how people make decisions.  For example, in one question you were asked to estimate the height of Mt. Everest.  Some people were told that it was taller than 2,000 ft.  Other people were told that it was shorter than 45,500 ft.  It turns out that this initial number serves as an &#39;anchor.&#39;  People who are told it is &#39;taller than 2,000 ft&#39; reliably estimate Mt. Everest to be shorter than people who are told that it is &#39;shorter than 45,500 ft&#39;.  We are collecting data for this study in various laboratory and Internet samples to see if tasks like these &#39;work better&#39; in one setting versus another. Knowing this will help clarify when it is appropriate to do studies on-line compared to in the lab.</p>
